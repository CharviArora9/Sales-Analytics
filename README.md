# Sales-Analytics
Started by cleaning the data. Tasks during this section include: 
Drop NaN values from DataFrame 
Removing rows based on a condition 
Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype) 

Once the data is cleaned up a bit, we move the data exploration section. In this section we explore various business questions related to the data:
What was the best month for sales? 
How much was earned that month? 
What city sold the most product? 
What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product? 
What products are most often sold together? What product sold the most?
Why do you think it sold the most? 
To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include: Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat) Adding columns Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str) Using the .apply() method Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results Labeling our graphs
